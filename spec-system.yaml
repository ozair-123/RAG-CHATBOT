  name: "Book RAG Chatbot"
  description: >
    A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for the
    "AI-Driven & Spec-Driven Development Handbook" Docusaurus site.
    Users can ask questions about the book and also select text
    in the book and ask questions specifically about that selection.

  goals:
    - Answer questions grounded strictly in the book content.
    - Support two modes:
      - Global book QA (full-book RAG).
      - Selected-text QA (context-limited).
    - Expose a clean FastAPI backend.
    - Integrate with OpenAI Agents SDK and ChatKit.
    - Use Qdrant Cloud Free Tier as vector store.
  non_goals:
    - General web search.
    - Multi-user auth or account system.
    - Heavy analytics or logging (only basic logging).
